This is a general prompt that will be applied to any problem: 
I want you to make a printer that will print this:
    "GENERATED" new cases, then append them to the original cases
    -   dont add comments to the list
    -   its important that the new casee includes the original cases. 
    -   the total of cases should be 8, (16 if each test uses two cases pr iteration).
    -   cases should follow the constraints in description.txt
    -   cases should try and use the maximum limit of the constraints.
    -   try and apply some 'traps' to the cases, to make some cases a challange for the code. Note; this has to follow the constraints and be legal. no rule breaks.

#important
NOTE: Never change cases. you will do nothing outside the ''' #> ___ generated cases _______________________________ ''' comment. 

the printer will print the cases in these two formats: 
"
cases = [
    case_1,
    case_2,
    .
    .
    .
]
"
   and this:
"
case_1
case_2
.
.
.
"

Finally: add all of this and only this inside this comment at the bottom of the code:
''' #> ___ generated cases _______________________________

'''
